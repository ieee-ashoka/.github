<p id="description"> The IEEE Ashoka Student Branch was founded to foster holistic development among STEM students at Ashoka University. Our mission is to encourage excellence and collaboration across STEM disciplines, providing essential skills and leadership training for an industry or academia career. Through service programs and our flagship hands-on lab sessions, we aim to cultivate a diverse and inclusive STEM culture while increasing technical literacy in our local community. We have garnered immense positive feedback on our work over the years and iteratively grown our team to 40+ members (and counting!). Check out our website: https://www.ieee-ashoka.in/</p>
